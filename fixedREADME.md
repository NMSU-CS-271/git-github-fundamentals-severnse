Learning about GitHub is cool because it's something I've always heard about online but never really checked out. I'm glad I'm learning about it academically though because big words like "repository" are scary.
Branches can be used to test something out without adding it into your main project and forks do the same but for accessing other people's projects.
There's nothing I'm really confused about.
